# atom.io language-matlab-octave package

Atom.io language support for Matlab / Octave converted from TextMate Bundle:
https://github.com/textmate/matlab.tmbundle

## Release 0.2+
Release version 0.2+ updated using the most recent version of textmate tmbundle (it's, ahem, been about 4 years since last full update, which looks like 2 years out of sync with textmate -- sorry about that). Appears to be mostly minor changes and file formatting updates. Please do report any new issues as/if needed.
